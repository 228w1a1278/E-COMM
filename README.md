# QuickCart - Full Stack E-Commerce Website with Next.js

Welcome to **QuickCart**, a modern and feature-rich full stack e-commerce website built using **Next.js**. This project showcases my skills in full stack web development, including secure user authentication with **Clerk**, background job handling with **Inngest**, and seamless product/image management using **MongoDB** and **Cloudinary**. This e-commerce site is fully functional, with admin panel, cart, and order managementâ€”all hosted for free on **Vercel**!

## About the Project

QuickCart is not just an online storeâ€”it's a comprehensive full stack solution that demonstrates how real-world e-commerce platforms are built using modern technologies. With support for background processes and secure login flows, this app allows users to:

- **Register/Login securely** via Clerk.
- **Browse products** and add them to cart.
- **Place orders** with cart and checkout functionality.
- **Admin Panel** to manage products and view orders.
- **Real-time background jobs** handled via Inngest.
- **Image storage** powered by Cloudinary.

All features are built to scale and optimized for performance using server-side rendering and API routes in Next.js.

## Features

- **Clerk Authentication**: Secure sign-in, sign-up, and session management.
- **Cart Functionality**: Add to cart, view summary, and place orders.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Upload, update, and delete products; view orders.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Product, user, and order data stored securely.
- **Cloudinary Support**: Upload product images effortlessly.
- **Inngest Integration**: Handle webhooks and background jobs like processing orders or sending notifications.
- **Deployed on Vercel**: Live and accessible anywhere.


## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React)
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- **Storage**: Cloudinary

## Motivation

This e-commerce website was built as a full stack development portfolio project to demonstrate my ability to integrate third-party services, manage complex state (like cart/orders), and deploy production-ready applications. It reflects my skills in modern web development and backend API design using Next.js. I'm excited to use this as a base for future commercial projects and professional opportunities!

## Future Improvements

- Integrate **Stripe** or **Razorpay** for real-time payments.
- Add **Order Tracking** and customer support chat feature.
- Improve product recommendation using **AI-based suggestions**.
- Enable product reviews and ratings.
- Create **Mobile-first responsive design enhancements**.
